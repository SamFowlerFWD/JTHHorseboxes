2. **01_core_tables_and_rls.sql** - Core tables and RLS policies ✅ (Partially applied)
3. **02_comprehensive_schema.sql** - Full operations schema ⏳ (Needs deployment)
4. **03_monday_data.sql** - Sample data import ⏳
5. **04_functions_and_search.sql** - Vector search functions ⏳
6. **05_jth_model_data.sql** - JTH model specifications ⏳

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Manual Deployment via Supabase Dashboard

1. **Access SQL Editor**
   ```
   URL: https://nsbybnsmhvviofzfgphb.supabase.co/project/nsbybnsmhvviofzfgphb/sql
   ```

2. **Execute Remaining Migrations**
   - Open file: `02_comprehensive_schema.sql`
   - Copy entire contents
   - Paste in SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"
   - Repeat for files 03, 04, and 05

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   node verify-deployment.js
   ```

### Alternative: Execute All at Once
If the dashboard can handle large queries:
1. Copy contents of `00_COMPLETE_MIGRATION.sql`
2. Paste in SQL Editor
3. Execute (may take 1-2 minutes)

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] All tables created (30+ tables expected)
- [ ] RLS policies enabled on all tables
- [ ] Indexes created for performance
- [ ] Vector extension enabled
- [ ] Sample data loaded
- [ ] JTH models populated with specifications
- [ ] Storage buckets created (gallery, documents, configurator)

## 📈 Database Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Enabled on core tables
- Admin-only access for sensitive operations
- Public read for pricing and content
- User-specific access for configurations

### Performance Optimization
- Indexes on foreign keys
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Vector index for similarity search
- Updated_at triggers for audit trails

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for valid values
- Unique constraints where appropriate
- Cascade deletes for related data

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Extensions Required**
   - uuid-ossp ✅ (Enabled)
   - vector (For AI search - check status)
   - pg_trgm (For text search - check status)

2. **Storage Buckets**
   The migration creates storage buckets. Verify in Dashboard:
   - gallery (public)
   - documents (private)
   - configurator (public)

3. **API Exposure**
   Some tables may need manual API exposure:
   - Dashboard → Table Editor → Select table → API Settings → Enable

## 🎯 Critical for Client Inspection

### Priority Items
1. **Configurator Functionality**
   - pricing_options table ✅
   - saved_configurations table ⏳
   - JTH model data ⏳

2. **Lead Capture**
   - leads table ✅
   - Lead activities tracking ⏳

3. **Knowledge Base**
   - knowledge_base table ✅
   - Vector search functions ⏳
   - Sample FAQs ⏳

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"relation already exists"**
   - Safe to ignore, table already created

2. **"permission denied"**
   - Ensure using SQL Editor with admin access

3. **Timeout errors**
   - Split migration into smaller chunks
   - Execute one file at a time

4. **Vector extension not found**
   - Enable in Dashboard → Database → Extensions

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Complete Migration Deployment**
   - Execute remaining SQL files (02-05)
   - Verify all tables created

2. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Create test lead via API
   - Save configurator configuration
   - Query knowledge base

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Check query response times
   - Verify indexes are being used
   - Test vector search accuracy

4. **Security Audit**
   - Verify RLS policies work correctly
   - Test authentication flows
   - Check API key permissions

## 🏁 Conclusion

The database deployment is **partially complete**. Core tables for leads, pricing, blog, and knowledge base are operational. The comprehensive operations schema and JTH model data still need to be deployed via the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor.

**Estimated time to complete:** 15-30 minutes of manual SQL execution in dashboard.
