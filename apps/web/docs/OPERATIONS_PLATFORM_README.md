## How to Deploy and Use

### Prerequisites
- Supabase project with service role key
- Next.js 14 application
- PostgreSQL database via Supabase

### Deployment Steps

#### 1. Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Navigate to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Create new query
4. Copy contents of `/supabase/migrations/005_comprehensive_operations.sql`
5. Run the query

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase migration up
```

**Option C: Via Script**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/apply-operations-migration.ts
```

#### 2. Verify Installation

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-operations-platform.ts
```

Expected output:
- All database tables accessible
- RLS policies active
- Real-time subscriptions working
- API endpoints responding

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

#### 4. Access the Platform

**Operations Dashboard**:
- Sales Pipeline: `/ops/pipeline`
- Build Tracking: `/ops/builds`
- Inventory: `/ops/inventory`
- Reports: `/ops/reports`

**Customer Portal**:
- Build Tracker: `/portal/tracker/[buildId]`
- Documents: `/portal/documents`

## Key Workflows

### 1. Lead to Build Workflow

1. **Lead Creation**:
   - Lead enters via website form or manual entry
   - Automatically assigned to sales team
   - Lead score calculated

2. **Pipeline Progression**:
   - Drag lead through stages: Inquiry → Qualification → Specification → Quotation → Negotiation
   - Activities logged automatically
   - Configurator snapshot saved

3. **Contract & Close**:
   - Generate contract from deal
   - Customer signs electronically
   - Deal moves to "Closed Won"
   - Automation creates build record

4. **Build Tracking**:
   - Build appears in production dashboard
   - Stages created from templates
   - Team assigned
   - Customer gets tracker access

### 2. Production Workflow

1. **Build Initiation**:
   - Build created from contracted deal
   - Stages populated from model template
   - Materials reserved from inventory

2. **Stage Progression**:
   - Workshop updates task completion
   - Photos uploaded at each stage
   - Manager approves for customer visibility
   - Customer sees simplified progress

3. **Quality & Completion**:
   - Quality checks at key stages
   - Final inspection
   - Customer approval
   - Delivery scheduling

### 3. Customer Experience

1. **Portal Access**:
   - Customer receives tracker link
   - Sees simplified 8-stage progress
   - Views approved photos only

2. **Updates**:
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Milestone notifications
   - Estimated completion tracking

3. **Communication**:
   - Message workshop
   - View documents
   - Schedule delivery

## Security & Permissions

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Admin**: Full access to everything
2. **Manager**: Manage all operations, approvals
3. **Sales**: Manage deals, view customers
4. **Production**: Manage builds, inventory
5. **Workshop**: Update assigned tasks only
6. **Customer**: View own builds only

### RLS Policy Examples

**Customer sees own builds**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Customers see own builds" ON builds
  FOR SELECT USING (
    customer_id = auth.uid() OR
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM leads 
      WHERE leads.id = builds.deal_id 
      AND leads.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

**Workshop sees assigned tasks**:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Workshop sees assigned tasks" ON build_tasks
  FOR SELECT USING (
    assigned_to = auth.uid() OR
    get_user_role(auth.uid()) IN ('admin', 'production', 'manager')
  );
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Monitor real-time subscription connections
- Check database query performance
- Review automation execution logs
- Track RLS policy violations

### Regular Tasks
- Review and optimize slow queries
- Clean up old activity logs
- Archive completed builds
- Update stage templates as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Migration Fails**
- Check for existing tables/columns
- Ensure UUID extension is enabled
- Verify service role key permissions

**2. RLS Blocks Access**
- Verify user role in profiles table
- Check policy conditions
- Test with service role key

**3. Real-time Not Working**
- Check Supabase real-time is enabled
- Verify table replication settings
- Check WebSocket connections

**4. Drag-Drop Not Working**
- Ensure @hello-pangea/dnd is installed
- Check for conflicting CSS
- Verify touch events on mobile

## Next Steps & Enhancements

### Immediate Priorities
1. ✅ Apply migration to production
2. ✅ Test all workflows
3. ✅ Train staff on new system
4. ⏳ Import existing data

### Future Enhancements

- SMS updates for customers
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Mobile app for workshop
- Integration with accounting
- Automated reporting
- AI-powered insights
